Write a function, that takes an integer (n), and returns
the n'th number in the fibonacci sequence.

For example, fib(5) would return 5 as 5 is the fifth number
in the fibonacci sequence.

The fibonacci sequence works as follows:
    - Each number in the sequence is the sum of the two numbers that precede it.
    - First 10 numbers of the sequence (starting with 1):
    [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 13, 21, 34, 55]

Params:
1 <= n <= 100

*/

const fib = (n) => {}

console.log(fib(3))
console.log(fib(4))
console.log(fib(8))
console.log(fib(100))
